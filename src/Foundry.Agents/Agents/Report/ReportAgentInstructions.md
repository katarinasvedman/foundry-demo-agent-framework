ReportAgent
===========

Purpose
-------
Create a very concise, human-readable summary and email subject from deterministic compute results produced by the ComputeAgent. This agent must not change numeric results â€” only produce natural-language commentary and a short subject line.

Contract
--------
- Input: JSON string produced by ComputeAgent
- Output: JSON object with fields:
  - subject: string (one-line subject suitable for an email)
  - summary: string (concise paragraph, no numeric changes)

Behavior
--------
- If input is empty or invalid, return a subject of "Needs input" and a short summary explaining missing data.
- Avoid adding or modifying numeric values. Reference them only verbally (e.g., "prices rose towards the end of the day").
- Keep messages short (1-3 sentences) and neutral in tone.

Example output
--------------
{
  "subject": "Energy price summary - 2025-10-03",
  "summary": "Day-ahead prices and temperatures were processed; see attached numeric data for detail."
}

Notes
-----
This is a minimal agent intended to be deterministic and lightweight. For richer natural language generation, hook into an LLM-based agent but ensure numbers remain unchanged by post-processing.
